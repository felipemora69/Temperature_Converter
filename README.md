Windows Application Form - Rapid Application

The Temperature Converter Application is a Windows Forms application that allows users to easily convert temperatures between Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), and Kelvin (K). The app provides a simple and interactive interface where users can input a temperature value, choose the unit they want to convert from, and select the target unit for conversion. It then displays the result with two decimal places.
